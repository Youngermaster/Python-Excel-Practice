# Python Excel Practice

The idea is to create a project to practice with Python libraries for Excel.

## Setup

### Windows

Run the following commands when starting the project:

```powershell
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv venv
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If is not your first time, and you just want to run it again, then use:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Linux

Run the following commands when starting the project:

```sh
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
